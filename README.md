# Title
Restaurant Recommendation Model

# Authors
In collaboration with Ted Askoye, Marvin Oluoch, Gabriel Abura and Naomi Chebet

# Project Summary
This project uses Random Forest, NN, and XGBoost to build a model that would predict customers who are likely to order from the given restaurants.
We used multiple notebooks because the data was too large to consolidate everything in one notebook.
In this order:
1. Akeed_1_Train_and_Test_File_Preparation – Exploring and Merging the Datasets. This notebook also has the documentation part.
2. Akeed_2_Train_Data_Cleaning – Train Cleaning
3. Akeed_3_Test__Data_Cleaning – Test Cleaning
4. Akeed_4_Univariate_Analysis – Univariate analysis
5. Akeed_5_Bivariate_analysis – Bivariate Analysis
6. Akeed_6_Cluster_Implementation 
7. Akeed_7_Cluster_Analysis
8. Akeed_8_ Implementing_the_solution_with_Random_Forest_and_XGBoost – Modelling
9. Akeed_9_Neural_Networks_(MLP_Classifier)— challenging the solution
